##Author's Note

!!!!!!Thought Process!!!!!!!!!!

##1: Created States for the individual ingridients(which was a bit stressful)
e.g const [mayoCount, setMayoCount] = useState(2);

##2: Created an object containing each ingridient and the current amount the user has added, which is by default = 0
e.g const burger = {
mayo: 0,
salad: 0,
cutlet: 0,
};

##3: Now, for the best part, i'm using a very Intuitive(i must say) spread syntax technique i discovered to repeat a particular Ingredient based on the current count
e.g {[...Array(burger.mayo + mayoCount)].map((index) => {
return (img src=IMAGEURL />);
})}
